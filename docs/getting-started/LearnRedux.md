# Learn Redux

We have a variety of resources available to help you learn Redux, no matter what your background or learning style is.

## Just the Basics

If you're brand new to Redux and want to understand the basic concepts, see:

- The **[Motivation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation)** behind building Redux, the **[Core Concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/coreconcepts)**, and the **[Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/threeprinciples)**.
- The **[basic tutorial in the Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/basics)**
- Redux creator Dan Abramov's **free ["Getting Started with Redux" video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** on Egghead.io
- Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's **["Redux Fundamentals" slideshow](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/03/presentation-reactathon-redux-fundamentals/)** and **[list of suggested resources for learning Redux](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/12/blogged-answers-learn-redux/)**
- If you learn best by looking at code and playing with it, check out our list of **[Redux example applications](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples)**, available as separate projects in the Redux repo, and also as interactive online examples on CodeSandbox.
- The **[Redux Tutorials](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-tutorials.md)** section of the **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)**.  Here's a top list of our recommended tutorials:
    - Dave Ceddia's posts [What Does Redux Do? (and when should you use it?)](https://daveceddia.com/what-does-redux-do/) and [How Redux Works: A Counter-Example](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/) are a great intro to the basics of Redux and how to use it with React, as is this post on [React and Redux: An Introduction](http://jakesidsmith.com/blog/post/2017-11-18-redux-and-react-an-introduction/).
    - Valentino Gagliardi's post [React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: Learning Redux in 2018](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/) is an excellent extended introduction to many aspects of using Redux.
    - The CSS Tricks article [Leveling Up with React: Redux](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/) covers the Redux basics well.
    - This [DevGuides: Introduction to Redux](http://devguides.io/redux/) tutorial covers several aspects of Redux, including actions, reducers, usage with React, and middleware.


## Intermediate Concepts

Once you've picked up the basics of working with actions, reducers, and the store, you may have questions about topics like working with asynchronous logic and AJAX requests, connecting a UI framework like React to your Redux store, and setting up an application to use Redux:

- The **["Advanced" docs section](https://redux.js.org/advanced)** covers working with async logic, middleware, routing.
- The Redux docs **["Learning Resources"](https://redux.js.org/introduction/learning-resources)** page points to recommended articles on a variety of Redux-related topics.
- Sophie DeBenedetto's 8-part **[Building a Simple CRUD App with React + Redux](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/building-a-simple-crud-app-with-react-redux-part-1/)** series shows how to put together a basic CRUD app from scratch.


## Real-World Usage

Going from a TodoMVC app to a real production application can be a big jump, but we've got plenty of resources to help:

- Redux creator Dan Abramov's **[free "Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux" video series](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)** builds on his first video series and covers topics like middleware, routing, and persistence.
- The **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)** answers many common questions about how to use Redux, and the **["Recipes" docs section](https://redux.js.org/recipes)** has information on handling derived data, testing, structuring reducer logic, and reducing boilerplate.
- Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's **["Practical Redux" tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)** demonstrates real-world intermediate and advanced techniques for working with React and Redux (also available as **[an interactive course on Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/collection/5687753853370368/5707702298738688)**).  
- The **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)** has categorized articles on working with [reducers and selectors](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-reducers-selectors.md), [managing side effects](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-side-effects.md), [Redux architecture and best practices](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-architecture.md), and more.
- Our community has created thousands of Redux-related libraries, addons, and tools.  The **["Ecosystem" docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem)** lists our recommendations, and there's a complete listing available in the **[Redux addons catalog](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links)**.
- If you're looking to learn from actual application codebases, the addons catalog also has a list of **[purpose-built examples and real-world applications](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/apps-and-examples.md)**.

Finally, Mark Erikson is teaching a series of **[Redux workshops through Workshop.me](#redux-workshops)**.  Check the [workshop schedule](https://workshop.me/?a=mark) for upcoming dates and locations.

## Help and Discussion

The **[#redux channel](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)** of the **[Reactiflux Discord community](http://www.reactiflux.com)** is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux.  Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - come join us!


## Before Proceeding Further

Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation.  Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.

Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:
* You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
* You need a single source of truth for your state
* You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient

Yes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.
